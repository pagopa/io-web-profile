# io-web-profile

``io-web-profile`` is the IO web platform that allows citizens to logout from the IO App session.

This repository contains the code that composes the io-web-profile front-end.


## Technologies
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts,react,next)](https://skillicons.dev)

This is Next.js 13 with app route project
## Prerequisites
### Env
In order to run the ``io-web-profile`` front-end locally you need the following tool installed on your machine.

- ``Node.js 18.16.1``
- ``yarn 1.22``

The preferred way to set up the local environment is using nodenv to manage Node.js installation and corepack (included with Node.js) to manage the installation of yarn.

### Login SP

Given that the login for io-web-profile relies on the JWT generated by hub-spid-login, it is necessary to run hub-spid-login-ms service in the background. In order to enable JWTs we recommend following this part of the documentation.

You can find the hub-spid-login project at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/pagopa/hub-spid-login-ms

To ensure proper execution of the service, please follow the documentation provided by hub-spid-login. Additionally, make the following modifications to the default values within the hub-spid-login .env file:

``ENDPOINT_ERROR=http://localhost:3000/accedi/errore``
``ENDPOINT_SUCCESS=http://localhost:3000/it/accedi
``
``
ENABLE_JWT=true``

This will help align the necessary settings for successful integration.

Note: The port used here is the same one used to expose the web app.

### BackEnd API Mock

In order to simulate the backend, we can use Mockoon as a service to mock the backend. Install Mockoon (or start the portable version) downloadable from the website: https://mockoon.com/download/

Once it's launched, click on:

File -> Open Environment

and select the api mock file (mockoon_api.json) located in /mock folder.

Once the environment is loaded, press the "play icon" to start the Mockoon server.

## Installation

To test the webapp locally:

Install the project (if you haven't already). Run from the root folder the following commands.

```bash
# to install the dependencies
yarn install
```

```bash
# to generate the client and types with openapi-codegen-ts
yarn generate
```
    
## Run

Make sure that the environment variables in the nev files are filled in, refer to the example file (.env.example). 
If you are in development mode, remember to add ```NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true```

To run the webapp locally:

```bash
# to run in dev mode
yarn run dev

```
The application will be running in development mode, you can access it locally by visiting: http://localhost:3000
 in your web browser.

```bash
# to build
yarn run build

#to run build solution
yarn run start

```
You can access the application in production mode by visiting: http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
